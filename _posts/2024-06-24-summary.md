I am a PhD. student at [SWTV Lab](https://swtv.kaist.ac.kr/) at KAIST.  
I am currently interested in the following research topics:  
* Automated dynamic program state extraction and data-based analysis
  * I implemented a program state extraction tool for C/C++ using LLVM IR transform passes.  
  You can extract any memory state of each program execution.  
  For example, you can extract values that are used for each function call.  
  I am currently working on machine learning-based analysis on extracted state data.
* Automated test input generation for C/C++
  * I am implementing automated unit driver code generation tool for C++ using Clang APIs.
* Automated fault localization
  * By analyzing dyanimc execution data, I believe we can localize faults more accurately than relying on static data and coverage.
